# Fill levels of Swiss reservoir lakes

Reservoir lakes are basically giant batteries that are able to store and deliver electric energy. The **Swiss Federal Office of Energy** (SFOE) regularly [publishes](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home/supply/statistics-and-geodata/energy-statistics/electricity-statistics.html) weekly data concerning the current fill level of Swiss reservoir lakes in GWh and the current fraction of the maximum possible fill level. Unfortunately, the data from the SFOE is only available as PDF. This repository provides the data in csv format (ranging from 1997-01-06 until 2020-06-22) which was obtained through a PDF scraping (2003-01-06 until 2020-06-22) and manual integration (1997-01-06 until 2002-12-30; only partial data available) of the yearly PDF files from the SFOE.
