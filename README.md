The **Swiss Federal Office of Energy** (SFOE) regularly [publishes](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home/supply/statistics-and-geodata/energy-statistics/electricity-statistics.html) weekly data concerning the water levels of Swiss reservoirs. These reservoir lakes are used for energy production and storage. Unfortunately, the data from the SFOE is only available as PDF. This repository provides the data in csv format which was obtained through a PDF scraping of the yearly files from the SFOE. The data ranges from 2003-01-06 until 2020-06-22.
